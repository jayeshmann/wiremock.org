# WireMock API templates library

Using a existing template from the templates library, you can quickly get an API mock running on your local machine or in the cloud.

Browse the [library.wiremock.org](https://library.wiremock.org) site to view an extensive set of mock API templates and examples
to use with both [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) and [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io).
