# WireMock as a Standalone Service

YOu can run WireMock as a standalone service,
configured using the Java API, JSON over HTTP, or JSON files.
We provide both a JAR file and Docker image distributions.

## Running WireMock

## Management

When WireMock runs as a standalone service, it can be managed through its REST API.

- [WireMock Administration](./standalone/administration.md)
- [Admin API Reference](./standalone/admin-api-reference.md)

## API Clients

There are several API clients that work with the standalone WireMock instance.
Check out the [Solution pages](./solutions/README.md) for more info and pointers.
